# Arduino-Based-Car

This project aimed to create a flexible robotic car that could be controlled through voice commands, an Android application with a microcontroller, or autonomously using ultrasonic sensors. 

By integrating these control methods, the car provided a range of options for users to interact with it. 

Voice commands offered a hands-free and intuitive control experience, while the Android application allowed for easy control via a smartphone. 

The inclusion of ultrasonic sensors enabled autonomous navigation by detecting obstacles and adjusting the car's path. 

This project demonstrated the versatility of the robotic car, offering multiple control modes to suit different user preferences and scenarios.
